## CiManGi
:wave: Hi,
CiManGi is a web app designed to foster a supportive community for individuals seeking a healthy lifestyle. Here, you can explore healthy recipes, engage in discussions about food, and connect with others on their wellness journeys.

**## Installation**

CiManGi has two parts: a front-end built with Angular and a back-end built with Ruby on Rails. Installation instructions for each are provided below:

**Front-End (Angular):**

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or above) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2.  **Clone the Repository:** (Replace with instructions on how to access the front-end codebase)
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the cloned directory and run `npm install` to install the required Angular dependencies.
4.  **Development Server:** To start the development server and view the application locally, run `ng serve`. This will typically launch the app at http://localhost:4200/ in your web browser.

**Back-End (Ruby on Rails):**

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Ruby (version 2.6 or above) and Rails installed on your system. You can check their versions by running `ruby -v` and `rails -v` in your terminal.
2.  **Clone the Repository**
3.  **Gemfile Installation:** Navigate to the cloned directory and run `bundle install` to install the required Ruby gems specified in the Gemfile.
4.  **Database Setup:** Configure your database connection details in the `config/database.yml` file.(contact me in private for issues)
5.  **Database Migration:** Run `rails db:migrate` to create the database tables based on the application's models.
6.  **Development Server:** Start the Rails development server by running `rails server`. This will typically make the application accessible at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

**## Usage**

CiManGi is a desktop web application, meaning it's designed to be accessed through a web browser on your computer. Once you've installed the front-end and back-end components following the instructions above, you can access the application by visiting the appropriate URL in your browser (http://localhost:4200/ for the front-end and http://localhost:3000/ for the back-end if you haven't changed the default port numbers).
